    detailed_description:
      "As part of a European Union research programme with my university (BAP), my thesis focused on exploring the detrimental consequences of Urban Heat Islands (UHI) caused by rapid urbanization and inadequate government policies. UHI exacerbates resource consumption, environmental footprint, and poses risks to human health and comfort. I emphasized the need for new design and adaptation strategies in urban settlements to reduce energy consumption and environmental impact.\n\nTo investigate the thermal conditions under UHI effects, I utilized the Urban Weather Generator (UWG), a simulation package written in Python. This powerful tool allowed me to model and analyze the impact of various parameters on UHI intensity. The simulation incorporated geometric data created using Rhinoceros3D, a 3D modeling software, to accurately represent the urban environment.\n\nIn my research, I employed sensitivity analysis, a valuable method to measure the impact of input variables on the output. Sensitivity analysis helps identify the most influential parameters and understand their contributions to the overall UHI effect. It provides valuable insights for modeling, decision-making, and developing effective mitigation strategies.\n\nThrough global sensitivity analysis, I assessed UHI increase in a residential district in Ankara, Turkey, and identified the parameters that significantly contribute to UHI effects. By conducting simulations during average summer and winter weeks, I also explored the seasonal impact on UHI.\n\nThe findings of my thesis highlight the urgent need for sustainable urban development and offer valuable insights for mitigating the adverse effects of UHI.\n\nYou can also explore the source code of the project from the link on the upper right.",

Entering the food chain both as prey and predator, plastic simply kills. The second chapter, Dark Ocean looks at the darkest depths of the ocean floor, where humans are drilling for an equally dark substance called petroleum. The third chapter, Phantom Ocean reveals that as humans devoured shrimp stir fry, overfishing has devoured 90% of top predators and continues to kill in a hungry hunt for what our species calls seafood. The fourth chapter, Acid Ocean observes the complex and delicately balanced chemistry of the ocean, providing a salty womb that allows myriad creatures to proliferate. A minute change in acidity, however, can and will take billions of lives. The fifth chapter, Stifled Ocean sees oceans just like the land, both are rendered man-made, with a new temperature, new salinity, and new acidity lives dictated by anthropogenic forces, ocean life is stifled. The last chapter, Hollow Ocean is dedicated to global warming.",
